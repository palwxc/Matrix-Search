# Matrix Search

Searches for a user defined string, inside a user defined 2D array of characters.

### Prerequisites

A development environment will be needed to test this project. [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) was used for the development of this project.

### Testing

Tests for this project can be run through the console. Sample inputs and outputs can be found in the files:

```
sample_input.txt
sample_output.txt
```

These test the program's ability to find strings inside a given 2D array of characters. The program returns the string's start and stop coordinates, or alerts the user that the string was not found.
